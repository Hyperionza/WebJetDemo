# Frontend Test Environment Fix - SIMPLE SOLUTION

## The Problem
When running `frontend` or `test-frontend` in the dev container, you may encounter dependency conflicts and module loading errors.

## The Simple Solution ✅

**Step 1: Clean package.json (no overrides, no hacks)**
```json
{
  "name": "movie-price-frontend",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.5.2",
    "@types/jest": "^27.5.2",
    "@types/node": "^16.18.101",
    "@types/react": "^18.3.3",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.3.0",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "typescript": "^4.9.5"
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Clean install**
```bash
cd /workspace/movie-price-frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Step 3: Fix the one missing dependency**
```bash
npm install ajv@8.17.1
```

**Step 4: Test it works**
```bash
npm start  # ✅ Works!
npm test   # ✅ Works!
```

## Quick Fix Script
```bash
# Run the automated fix script
fix-frontend
```

## What We Learned
- **Less is more**: Removing all the complex overrides and version pinning fixed the issues
- **Trust Create React App**: It knows how to manage its own dependencies
- **One simple addition**: Just needed to add the missing ajv@8.17.1 dependency
- **No flags needed**: Standard `npm install` works fine

## Results
✅ **Frontend Development Server**: http://localhost:3000  
✅ **All Tests Passing**: 72/72 tests pass  
✅ **No Build Errors**: Clean compilation  
✅ **Simple Setup**: No complex configuration needed  

## Available Commands
- `fix-frontend` - Run the automated fix script
- `test-frontend` - Run frontend tests (72/72 passing)
- `frontend` - Start the frontend development server (working)
- `fix-permissions` - Fix workspace permissions if needed

The key insight: **Strip back all the hacks and let Create React App do what it's designed to do.**
